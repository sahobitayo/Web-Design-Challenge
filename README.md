# Web-Design-Challenge

Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

### Background
For this project, we used what I used knowledge of HTML and CSS to create a web page which was used to analyze weather data. 


#### Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude
For this, a visualization dashboard website using visualizations will be created showing plotted weather data.In this webpage, individual pages for each plot and a means to navigate between them would be created. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

Website Requirements
The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

1) A landing page containing:

An explanation of the project.
Links to each visualizations page.

Four visualization pages, each with:

A descriptive title and heading tag.
The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.


2) A "Comparisons" page that:

Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
Uses a bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

The grid must be two visualizations across on screens medium and larger, and 1 across on extra-small and small screens.

3) A "Data" page that:

Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

The table must be a bootstrap table component. Hint

The data must come from exporting the .csv file as HTML, or converting it to HTML.

The website must, at the top of every page, have a navigation menu that:

Has the name of the site on the left of the nav which allows users to return to the landing page from any page.
Contains a dropdown on the right of the navbar named "Plots" which provides links to each individual visualization page.
Provides two more links on the right: "Comparisons" which links to the comparisons page, and "Data" which links to the data page.
Is responsive (using media queries). 

Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.
